# CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL 

Repository created to store some key concepts and assignments of the Harvard CS50-SQL course. [CS50SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/)

## Table of contents:

- [Week 0 - Querying:](Week%200%20Querying/) Introduction to basic database concepts and SQL queries.
- [Week 1 - Relating:](Week%201%20Relating/) Understanding relationships in databases, creating E-R diagrams, using subqueries, and mastering JOINs and GROUPs.
- [Week 2 - Designing:](Week%202%20Designing/)  Learn how to normalize a database, use `CREATE TABLE`, understand data types and storage classes, and apply table and column constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK, DEFAULT`, and `UNIQUE`. Plus, how to alter tables with `RENAME TO`, `DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, and `ADD COLUMN`.
- [Week 3 - Writing:](Week%203%20Writing/) Insert data into tables, import files, delete data, create constraints for foreign keys, update data, and use `CREATE TRIGGER` to automate actions.
- [Week 4 - Viewing:](Week%204%20Viewing/) Learn how to create a `VIEW` for simplifying, aggregating, partitioning, and securing our tables. Also, understand when and how to use a Common Table Expression (CTE).
- [Week 5 - Optimizing:](Week%205%20Optimizing/) Optimize SQL queries using indexes and partial indexes to improve performance and save space. Clean up the database with `VACUUM`, and use `TRANSACTION` to handle multiple queries as a single unit of work
- [Week 6 - Scaling:](Week%206%20Scaling/) Explore scaling databases with other RDBMS like `MySQL`, which may have different syntax. Learn about options like `ENUM`, `SET`, `PROCEDURES`, and `PREPARE STATEMENTS` to avoid SQL injection attacks. Understand access control for different users and the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling.
- [Final Project:](Project/) This project involved the design and implementation of a database system to emulate Spotify's data management structure. The database schema included tables for users, artists, albums, songs, and user-created playlists, maintaining the relationships between these entities. The project utilized both Data Definition Language (DDL) for creating the database schema and Data Manipulation Language (DML) for populating and querying the data.
