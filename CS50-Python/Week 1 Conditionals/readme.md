# Conditionals

Conditionals allow you, the programmer, to allow your program to make decisions: As if your program has the choice between taking the left-hand road or the right-hand road based upon certain conditions.

Built within Python are a set of *operators* that are used to ask mathematical questions.

`if` statements use `bool` or boolean values to decide whether or not to execute. If the statement of `x > y` is true, the compiler will register it as true and execute the code.
