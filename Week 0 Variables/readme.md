## Functions 

Functions are verbs or actions that the computer or computer language will already know how to perform. Functions take arguments that influence their behavior. If we look at the documentation for print youâ€™ll notice we can learn a lot about the arguments that the print function takes.

Looking at python's documentation, we can see that the print function automatically includes a piece of code `end='\n'`. This \n indicates that the print function will automatically create a line break when run. The print function takes an argument called end` and the default is to create a new line.

## Variables

A variable is just a container for a value within your own program.
In your program, you can introduce your own variable in your program by editing it to read

### Readability 

When deciding on your approach to a coding task, remember that one could make a reasonable argument for many approaches to the same problem.
Regardless of what approach you take to a programming task, remember that your code must be readable. You should use comments to give yourself and others clues about what your code is doing. Further, you should create code in a way that is readable.
