# Querying 

## What is a DataBase ?

A database is a way of organizing data such that you can perform four operations on it: 

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

A database management system (DBMS) is a way to interact with a database using a graphical interface or textual language.

## SQL

- It is structured.
- It has some keywords that can be used to interact with the database.
- It is a query language â€” it can be used to ask questions of data inside a database.
