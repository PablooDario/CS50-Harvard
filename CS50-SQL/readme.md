## Table of contents:

- [Week 0 - Querying:](Week%200%20Querying/) Basic Concepts of DataBases and introduction to SQL queries.
- [Week 1 - Relating:](Week%201%20Relating/) Relationships in the DataBases, E-R Diagram, Subqueries, JOIN and Groups.
- [Week 2 - Designing:](Week%202%20Designing/) Normalizing a DataBase, `CREATE TABLE`, Data Type and Storage Class, Table and Column Constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`) (`NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`, `UNIQUE`), Altering Tables (`RENAME TO`, `DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, `ADD COLUMN`).

- [Week 4 - Viewing:](Week%204%20Viewing/) Create a `VIEW`for *Simplifying*, *Aggregating*, *Partitioning* and *Securing* our tables, also when and how to use a **Common Table Expression**, 
- [Week 5 - Optimizing:](Week%205%20Optimizing/) Optimize our SQL queries usign **indexes** and **partial indexes** to also optimize space, delete unused space in our database with `VACUUM`, use a `TRANSACTION`as an individual unit of work for mutiple queries
- [Week 6 - Scaling:](Week%206%20Scaling/) Scale our Databases using other RDBMS like `MySQL` which have different syntax from other RDBMS and also other options like `ENUM`, `SET`, `PROCEDURES`, `PREPARE STATEMENTS` to avoid SQL Injections Attacks, etc... Controlling the access of different users and different types of scaling like **vertical** and **horizontal**.
